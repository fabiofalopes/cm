### **Prompt: Generate the Ultimate Exam "Cábula" in `README.md`**

**Mission:**

Your task is to transform the root `README.md` file into a hyper-condensed, expert-level study guide (a "cábula"). This is not a traditional README to explain a project; it is a personal, private knowledge base designed to be the single source of truth for handwriting onto a single A4 sheet (front and back) for a final exam. It must be brutally efficient and information-dense, assuming zero prior context is needed.

**Core Directives:**

1.  **Target File:** The entire output must be written directly into the `README.md` file in the project root, overwriting any existing content.
2.  **Content Constraint:** The guide **must not contain any literal code blocks** (e.g., Dart, JSON, XML). Instead, you must explain the *logic, patterns, rules, and sequential flow* of concepts. Textual descriptions and simple, text-based diagrams/structures are required.
3.  **Primary Source & Structure:** The document's main structure **must** follow the exam breakdown provided in `aulas-resumos/13-resumo-final-exame.md`. This file is your blueprint.

**Strategic Execution Plan:**

1.  **Analyze the Core Blueprint:** Begin by thoroughly analyzing `aulas-resumos/13-resumo-final-exame.md`. This defines the four main sections of your output.

2.  **Synthesize Knowledge Topic by Topic:** For each section of the exam blueprint, you must perform a multi-source analysis to distill the professor's core focus. Do not simply copy from one file. For each topic (e.g., "Repository Pattern," "StatefulWidget," "JSON Conversion"):
    *   **Foundation:** Read the relevant sections from the `aulas-md/` (for depth) and `aulas-resumos/` (for summary).
    *   **Validation:** Cross-reference the topic with the files in the `quiz/` directory. How is this concept tested? What are the common pitfalls or key details the quizzes focus on?
    *   **Professor's Emphasis:** Search the `youtube_transcripts/md/` files to find where the professor discusses this topic. Extract the *narrative*, the *practical advice*, and the *recurring emphasis*. This reveals what the professor truly deems important beyond the formal slides.
    *   **Practical Insight (Confidential):** Use the challenges in `very_userful_dont_mention/defesa-pratica-2025-vercao-c.md` as a mental model for the *kind* of problem-solving required. **Do not reference this file or its contents directly**, but use it to understand the expected level of practical application for theoretical concepts.

3.  **Draft the `README.md` Section by Section:** As you complete the synthesis for each topic, write its corresponding entry in the `README.md`.
    *   **For Part 1 (JSON):** Explain the *rules* of transformation (e.g., "A tag with multiple identical children becomes a list of objects," "Tag attributes become key-value pairs").
    *   **For Part 2 (Callbacks):** Describe the step-by-step *flow of data and state changes* conceptually. Trace the execution without writing the code.
    *   **For Part 3 (Flutter Concepts):** For each concept, provide a dense definition answering: What is it? Why does it matter? What is the crucial trade-off or reason for using it?
    *   **For Part 4 (Mobile Concepts):** This section must be the most detailed. Synthesize all sources to create a master summary of the core pillars of the course, prioritizing topics that appear frequently across lectures, quizzes, and transcripts. Focus on the "why" (e.g., "Why batch network requests? To let the radio sleep and save battery.").

4.  **Final Polish:** Once all sections are drafted, review the entire `README.md`. Ensure it is concise, uses strong formatting (bold, lists) to highlight key terms, and is logically structured for quick consultation during an exam. Eliminate all conversational text and redundancy. The final output should be pure, distilled knowledge.
